Python number guessing game completed as part of Codmetric Internship Task 2.
🎯 Number Guessing Game – Task 2 (CodMetric Internship)
📌 Description

This is my Task 2 for the CodMetric Internship program.
The project is an interactive Number Guessing Game built using Python.
The program generates a random number and allows the user to keep guessing until they find the correct answer, with helpful feedback provided for every guess.

🧠 What I Learned

Through this task, I strengthened my understanding of core programming concepts:

🔹 Using random number generation with random.randint()

🔹 Applying if-elif-else logic for decision making

🔹 Implementing loops to repeat the guessing process

🔹 Adding input validation using try-except
🔹 Using a counter variable to track attempts

🔹 Improving my logic building and interactive program design

📝 Features

✔ Random number generation
✔ User-friendly prompts
✔ Feedback for each guess (Too high / Too low)
✔ Tracks number of attempts
✔ Handles invalid inputs
✔ Clean and simple console interface
